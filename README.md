# first-nodejs-app
My First Nodejs Project

When run, this Project simply list the three Titles(Item) named "First", "Second" and "Third" using the get request.

It allows the user to input values in the input text box. On Submit, the input value will be posted to be included 
to the previously listed values.

The three main files of this project are: 
(1) app.js
(2) router.js
(3) index.ejs

app.js is the main file which will use the router.js file in which get and post router are set to render the index.ejs view
from the view folder.
